# Bucket
It's an old project of mine. An interpreter of my own programming language, with a focus on dynamics and clean code. The project was discontinued, it's just here for code reference and "historical file". Bucket is the spiritual predecessor of Ghost.

## Bucket Programming Language
Bucket is a esoteric programing language inspired in ZOMBIE, python, lua and C#. Bucket are hight level, iperative and terminal-oriented.
The name "Bucket" means Basic Unity-Control to Kindle Eletrical Tapes. With Bucket you can do simple scripts to read, edit, add, replace or anything an computer can do with user input. For example, a sand castle.
